# google-keep
A minimal Clone of Google Keep written in ReactJS with Material UI Components, themed to look exactly like Google Keep, with complex features like sharing, archiving, reminders etc. shoved away. The backend is a GraphQL server written in Golang, with data persisted in SQLite DB file, via GORM. The server implementation is complete with Cookie based Authentication, implemented using Authboss.
